# Recipe Page

This project is from [Techtonica](https://techtonica.org/)'s open source curriculum. The instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/Techtonica/curriculum/tree/master/projects/recipe-page). We use HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a website.

### Overview

Phase 1 of the project involves coding the structure of your webpage using HTML. This includes the ingredients, the steps needed to make the dish, links to similar recipes, and at least one photo.

Phase 2 of the project involves adding styling and pizazz using CSS. This includes changing the font style, font size, colors, and other qualities that interest you.

Phase 3 of the project involves incorporating Bootstrap. You'll add a navigation bar and several other Bootstrap components of your choosing.
